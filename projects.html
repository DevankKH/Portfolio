                        <p>
                            This project was created to serve as a portfolio for all my work. I will use this site to showcase my
                            personal projects, as well as all the design work I have done. The website has a left panel with my personal 
                            details and a right panel with a navigation bar and where all the content will be shown.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main sections include the Home tab for when the website first shows and it gives some information about
                            myself. 
                            The second tab is the projects tab that shows you all my work created through coding, you can click the 
                            relevant buttons to open the details about a project and all of them can be found on GitHub. 
                            The third tab is all my design work I have done and they are sorted in an accordian format to store the information neater and it looks ordered.
                            <br/>Lastly there is a download CV tab to download a 1 page version of my CV.

                        <p>
                            This project was created to showcase my express, node.js and javascript skills as well as HTML and CSS. This
                            project simulated a blog website where a user can post blogs and others can view it. The blogs posted are temporary
                            and last for the session as the main goal was to setup the site. The user can add blogs, view blogs, login.
                            As an upgrade the site can be implemented with a database to save the posts and login details.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first section is the home tab that shows all the posts. There is a search function and filter per genre
                            section that does work. The user can then navigate to add a blog, view a blog or login.
                            The add blog section includes a form that takes in certain input including text, images etc. This is used to store the 
                            blogs information and populate it when returning to the main page.
                            I have also created a login page with a form that saves user information when posted. This does not currently save anything
                            and is used for demonstation purposes, but an implementation idea is that we would not need the users name in the add blog form 
                            and you would only be allowed to add a blog if you were signed in. <br/>

                        <p>
                            This project was created to showcase my express, node.js and javascript skills as well as HTML and CSS, but primarily to also include my knowledge of API usage.
                            The user can search for a location either by name/city or by coordinates, after which the site will display the locations weather details, add a relevant weather image and change to the
                            relevant colour to match the weather scenario.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The website consists of one page with a drop down to either switch between coordinate or name search. The user will then be displayed the corrosponding input elements and once
                            they search the details will pop up in the center block. The colours are made to change corrosponding to weather condition. The project uses the Openweather API to get the weather details.<br/>
